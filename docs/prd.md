# ASCII Generative Sequencer (Web Edition) Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable users to create professional-quality music using natural language and text-based interfaces
- Provide accessible music production tools that work across all devices and platforms
- Build a thriving community around AI-assisted music creation and pattern sharing
- Establish the leading browser-based music production platform for live coding and traditional producers
- Create sustainable revenue through freemium model with premium AI and collaboration features
- Bridge the gap between simple music apps and complex desktop software
- Democratize music production by lowering technical and financial barriers

### Background Context

The ASCII Generative Sequencer addresses critical pain points in the current music production landscape. Traditional DAWs like Ableton Live and Logic Pro require extensive learning curves and expensive hardware, while simple mobile apps lack the power needed for serious music creation. Live coding tools like TidalCycles offer powerful capabilities but have steep learning curves that exclude many potential users.

Our solution combines the accessibility of browser-based tools with the power of AI-assisted composition, creating a unique position in the market. By leveraging Web Audio API and modern browser technologies, we eliminate installation barriers while providing professional-quality audio processing. The integration of natural language AI makes advanced music production accessible to users without programming knowledge, while still supporting the live coding community with powerful text-based interfaces.

The current landscape shows strong demand for accessible music creation tools, with browser-based solutions gaining traction in educational and hobbyist markets. Our AI-first approach positions us to capture this growing market while building sustainable competitive advantages through community-driven development and innovative user experiences.
