# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

## Epic Goal

Establish the foundational infrastructure for the ASCII Generative Sequencer, including project setup, basic audio engine, ASCII editor with DSL parsing, and essential user interface components. This epic delivers a working prototype that can play basic patterns and provides the foundation for all subsequent development.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- This is a greenfield project with no existing system
- Target technology stack: React, TypeScript, Tone.js, CodeMirror 6, Web Audio API
- Integration points: Browser APIs, OpenAI API, static hosting

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added: Complete foundational infrastructure for browser-based music production
- How it integrates: Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Success criteria: Working prototype that can parse ASCII patterns and play audio

## Stories

1. **Story 1.1:** Project Setup & Development Environment - Complete development infrastructure
2. **Story 1.2:** Basic Audio Engine with Tone.js - Core audio playback capabilities
3. **Story 1.3:** ASCII Editor with CodeMirror 6 - Text-based pattern editing interface
4. **Story 1.4:** Basic DSL Parser & Pattern Engine - Pattern interpretation and execution
5. **Story 1.5:** Responsive Layout & Basic UI - User interface foundation
6. **Story 1.6:** ASCII Visualization System - Real-time visualizations for audio controls

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Modern browser compatibility (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
- [ ] Web Audio API support across target browsers
- [ ] Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- [ ] HTTPS-only operation for security compliance
- [ ] Progressive enhancement for older browsers

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Browser compatibility issues with Web Audio API
- **Mitigation:** Comprehensive cross-browser testing and fallback strategies
- **Rollback Plan:** Static fallback page with basic functionality

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (<3s load time, <100ms audio latency)
- [ ] Basic pattern examples working across all target browsers
- [ ] Development environment fully functional
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline operational
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
