# Epic 2: AI Integration & Pattern Generation

## Epic Goal

Implement the AI chat interface with OpenAI integration, enabling users to generate and modify patterns through natural language. This epic delivers the core differentiator of AI-assisted music creation while maintaining the text-based workflow.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**
- Foundation infrastructure from Epic 1 (audio engine, ASCII editor, DSL parser)
- Technology stack: React, TypeScript, OpenAI API, Web Audio API
- Integration points: ASCII editor, pattern engine, user interface

**Enhancement Details:**
- What's being added: AI chat interface with natural language pattern generation and modification
- How it integrates: Seamless integration with existing ASCII editor and pattern engine
- Success criteria: Users can create and modify patterns through natural language conversation

## Stories

1. **Story 2.1:** AI Chat Interface - User interface for AI interaction
2. **Story 2.2:** OpenAI API Integration - Cloud-based AI pattern generation
3. **Story 2.3:** Pattern Modification via AI - AI-assisted pattern editing
4. **Story 2.4:** AI Pattern Generation - Natural language pattern creation

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] OpenAI API integration with secure key management
- [ ] Fallback handling for API failures
- [ ] Privacy-compliant data handling
- [ ] Rate limiting and usage tracking
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility for chat interface
- [ ] Mobile-optimized chat experience

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** OpenAI API reliability and cost management
- **Mitigation:** Rate limiting, usage monitoring, and fallback strategies
- **Rollback Plan:** Disable AI features with graceful degradation to manual editing
